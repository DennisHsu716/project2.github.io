I used two vibration motor mean fan and 16mm MCH Ceramic Heater

## Usage
The water too cold, so the light turn to blue light.

Because the MCH let the water back to the set value, so the light back to the green.

## About future plans
Replace the cooling and refrigeration devices with more advanced models, and design a base that can conceal the circuit board and battery, thereby enhancing the aesthetic appeal.
