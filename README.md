[Paper Page](https://dennishsu716.github.io/project2.github.io/project2/file/paper.pdf)

Due to the rapid advancement of communication technology in recent years, communication-related products have become an indispensable part of people's lives. Among the various communication systems, RF passive components are widely utilized. For instance, in smartphones, passive circuits and components account for over 30% of the device, with filters and antennas being particularly crucial. To address the diverse needs of different communication system applications, a variety of RF components have been extensively employed in wireless communication systems. These components include filters, antennas, attenuators, phase shifters, mixers, and others, all of which are essential in high-frequency circuits. This report aims to propose a low-pass filter designed to eliminate aliasing effects in circuits, thereby ensuring stable circuit operation. Furthermore, low-pass filters are cost-effective, making them user-friendly.
