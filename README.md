Due to the rapid advancement of communication technology in recent years, communication-related products have become an indispensable part of people's lives. Among the various communication systems, RF passive components are widely utilized. For instance, in smartphones, passive circuits and components account for over 30% of the device, with filters and antennas being particularly crucial. To address the diverse needs of different communication system applications, a variety of RF components have been extensively employed in wireless communication systems. These components include filters, antennas, attenuators, phase shifters, mixers, and others, all of which are essential in high-frequency circuits. This report aims to propose a low-pass filter designed to eliminate aliasing effects in circuits, thereby ensuring stable circuit operation. Furthermore, low-pass filters are cost-effective, making them user-friendly.

## About future plans
The multifunctionalization and miniaturization of wireless communication products have become prominent market trends. In alignment with the evolution of wireless communication components, the focus is shifting towards high frequency, miniaturization, and modularization. In recent years, wireless communication has experienced significant growth, particularly in mainstream applications such as mobile phones, wireless local area networks, global positioning systems, Bluetooth, the Internet of Things, and wearable devices. However, in comparison to international leaders, our progress in high-frequency components and modular technology for wireless communication remains limited. Currently, the major global integrated component manufacturers are predominantly based in Japan, the United States, and Europe, including Japan's Murata, Kyocera, and TDK; America's CTS; and Europe's Bosch and CMAC. In contrast, domestic manufacturers have entered the market later, resulting in a relatively low market share on the global stage. Given that the application of wireless communication will be central to future market growth, there is a concerted effort to develop innovative high-frequency components and advanced modular technology, with the aim of capitalizing on growth opportunities in the future of wireless communication.
