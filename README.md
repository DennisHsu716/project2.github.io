# 📡 Low-Pass Filter Design
## 📝 Summary  
[Paper Page](https://github.com/DennisHsu716/project2.github.io/blob/main/project2/file/paper.pdf)

With the rapid evolution of communication technologies, RF passive components have become essential in modern devices. In smartphones alone, passive elements such as filters and antennas comprise over 30% of the circuitry. This project proposes a low-pass filter designed to eliminate aliasing effects in electronic circuits, ensuring smooth and stable operation. Low-pass filters are not only effective but also cost-efficient and easy to implement, making them a practical choice for widespread applications.  

## ⚙️ Environment  
* Designed and tested using circuit simulation tools
* Layout and fabrication performed using PCB design software (e.g., Altium Designer / Eagle / KiCad)
* Measurement equipment: Oscilloscope, Frequency Analyzer, Function Generator

## 🔭 Future Plans  
The trend in wireless communication leans toward miniaturization, high-frequency, and modularization. While international manufacturers (Murata, Kyocera, TDK, CTS, Bosch) lead the market, domestic development is still growing. This project aims to:  
* Contribute to the local development of RF passive components
* Evolve toward mass-producible, modular filter designs
* Explore integration into mainstream wireless applications including:
    * Smartphones
    * Wireless LAN
    * GPS
    * Bluetooth
    * IoT and wearable devices

## 🧪 Technical Goals
* Optimize insertion loss and cutoff frequency
* Ensure stability and cost-effectiveness
* Create scalable designs for future miniaturized modules
